## Running
### Running in a Kubernetes cluster without RBAC enabled

Just run the pod by itself:

```bash
# kubectl run --rm -i -t kube-advisor --image=mcr.microsoft.com/kube-advisor --restart=Never
```

### Running in a Kubernetes cluster with RBAC enabled

#### Create the service account and cluster role binding

```bash
# kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/kube-advisor/master/sa.yaml?token=ABLLDrNcuHMro9jQ0xduCaEbpzLupzQUks5bh3RhwA%3D%3D
```

#### Run the pod

```bash
# kubectl run --rm -i -t kube-advisor --image=mcr.microsoft.com/kube-advisor --restart=Never --overrides="{ \"apiVersion\": \"v1\", \"spec\": { \"serviceAccountName\": \"kube-advisor\" } }"
```

#### If desired, delete the service account and cluster role binding

```bash
# kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/kube-advisor/master/sa.yaml?token=ABLLDrNcuHMro9jQ0xduCaEbpzLupzQUks5bh3RhwA%3D%3D
```
